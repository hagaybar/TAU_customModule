    }
  ],
  "summary": "Modified the cenlib-map-button component to hide the original Primo Locate button and display the Shelf Map button in its place. When the Shelf Map button should be shown (valid mapping exists), the component finds the Locate button via DOM traversal and hides it. The button reference is stored for cleanup in ngOnDestroy, which restores the Locate button if the component is destroyed. SCSS was updated to use inline-block display for proper alignment within the location card."
