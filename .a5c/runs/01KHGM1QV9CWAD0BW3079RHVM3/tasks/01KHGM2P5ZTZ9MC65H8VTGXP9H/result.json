The feature supports both mouse events (mousedown/mousemove/mouseup/mouseleave) and touch events (touchstart/touchmove/touchend/touchcancel). The pan position is tracked via panOffsetX and panOffsetY properties, which are combined with the zoom scale in the mapTransform getter (translate + scale). The pan position resets when resetZoom() is called. Visual feedback is provided via cursor changes (grab when zoomed, grabbing when actively panning)."
